# bankPRP90

This is a project between Mike, Mauricio and Glenn.
This project is for learning how to work together with a team in preparation for our Precourse and HR SEI.
Thanks for looking!

Tasks:

1. DOM manipulation: 
    - add movements(transactions) to the DOM  
    - try it with all accounts = [account1,...etc]
    - add total balance to the DOM

2. Conversion functions (example USD to EUR)
    Let's try to do it many ways.
    - regular functions(for loops etc)
    - call back function
    - es6+
    - arrow Functions

3. Create username for each account:
    <!-- -const account2 = {
    owner: 'Glenmore Vinoya',
    movements: [5000, 3400, -150, -790, -3210, -1000, 8500, -30],
    interestRate: 1.5,
    pin: 2222,
    username: 'gv' //example +++======>>> create for all accounts
    }; -->

4. Create array deposits(movements that are more than 0)

5. Create array withdrawals(movements that are less than 0)

6. Create array totals (sum all movements)

7. We will add more as we advance...
